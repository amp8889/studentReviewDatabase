# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).  Also look at Github Insights in your repository to see how active you are and how active others are.

- On 10/16
  - You'll have about 30 minutes at the start of class to get ready.
  - From there we will random presentation order so you could first or last or anywhere in between

## Week 8 ##
- Perhaps on "scenarios" slide use bullets not long, long block of text (you can use the notes view to read the text, but the viewer only see the bullets)
- Nice to see the scenario for both audiences (students and faculty)
- Nice basic layout of website 
- Don't walk the web site functionality, instead consider using one of scenarios to the show the functionality.
  
## Week 9 ##
- Look at capturing actionable feedback from the mid-term presentation as stories to make sure they are addressed in the final presentation
- Final presentation - https://github.com/mschray/IPro497Sample/blob/main/Course%20Content/Final%20Presentation%20Template.pptx
- GitHub flow - https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow

## Week 10 ##
- The dry run and final presentation dates were incorrectly listed on Tuesday.  The syllabus has been changed to show Dry run (11/20) and final presentation (11/27) dates changed to be on Monday (e.g., normal class time).
- Make sure all the stories you need for your primary scenario are on the board. 
- Consider labeling all the stories for your primary scenario to make it easy to identify and work on those stories.

## Week 11 ##
- Drive to complete one scenario from your teams Product Design Doc
- I will be picking one to two teams to represent our class on 7/20 or 7/13
- Dry run AND Final presentation template - https://github.com/mschray/IPro497Sample/blob/main/Course%20Content/Final%20Presentation%20Template.pptx
