## Problem Statements

College students often struggle to find a single, comprehensive source of information that combines professor ratings, course difficulty, and other key course characteristics, which leads to a time-consuming and fragmented decision-making process when selecting classes. Our app aims to solve this problem by containing all relevant course information in a single place.

### Main Stakeholders

#### Description

College students are the primary users of our app. They will use it to make informed decisions about which classes to take, based on various parameters like course difficulty, amount of effort required, teaching style of the professor, etc. Prospective students who are deciding which university to attend may also use the app to get an idea of the courses and professors at different institutions.

#### Needs and Goals

* Accurate and comprehensive information: Students need reliable and detailed information to make informed decisions.
* Easy to use interface: The app needs to be user-friendly, as students of all levels of tech-savviness will be using it.
* Anonymity and Privacy: Students might be more honest in their reviews if they know that their identity will be protected.

### Secondary Stakeholders

#### Description

Professors and university staff are another important stakeholder because our app will directly impact their teaching and courses. While they won't be the primary users of the app, they may use it to gain insights into student feedback and make necessary adjustments to their courses or teaching methods.

#### Needs and Goals

* Fair Representation: Professors will want the ratings and reviews to be fair and accurate, as their professional reputation may be impacted by the app.
* Constructive Feedback: While negative feedback is inevitable, professors and university staff will likely prefer feedback that is constructive and actionable, rather than just complaints.
* Ethical Use of Data: Professors and university staff may have concerns about how the data is used and will want to ensure that it is used ethically and responsibly.

Importance: This is the core functionality of the app and will provide the most value to users. It helps students make informed decisions and professors to receive actionable feedback.

### Advanced Search and Filter Functionality

Description: Users should be able to search for courses or professors and apply various filters like department, difficulty level, or specific tags (e.g., "hands-on", "heavy workload") to narrow down their options.

Importance: This feature will enhance the user experience by enabling users to quickly and easily find the information they are looking for.

### Anonymity and Privacy Protection

Description: Users should be able to provide feedback anonymously, and their personal data should be protected at all times.

Importance: This feature is crucial to ensure honest feedback and to encourage users to share their opinions without fear of repercussions.

### User-Friendly Interface

Description: The app should be intuitive and easy to use, regardless of the user's level of tech-savviness.

Importance: A user-friendly interface will ensure that the app is accessible to all users and will encourage higher usage rates.

### Data Reliability and Integrity

Description: The app should have mechanisms in place to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of the reviews. This could involve user verification, spam detection, or moderation of reviews.

Importance: Ensuring the reliability and integrity of the data is crucial to the app's credibility and usefulness. It will help ensure that the feedback is genuine and that users can trust the information provided.

## Top Two to Three Scenarios

1. Mike wants to enroll for a certain course. He checks out our app and reads reviews of multiple instructors teaching the course. Mike is able to distinguish the best professor and now has a better idea of which section to register for.
2. Sarah is a diligent student who wants to carefully select her courses for the next semester to ensure a balanced workload. She has heard mixed reviews about a particular professor and is unsure whether to take their course. Sarah discovers our app and decides to check the reviews. She finds detailed feedback from other students about the professor's teaching style, the course content, and the effort required. Sarah appreciates the comprehensive information, which includes not only numerical ratings but also qualitative feedback and tags like "engaging" and "heavy workload." With this information, she is able to make a well-informed decision and ultimately decides to take the course but also plans her schedule accordingly to manage the workload.
3. Alex, recently completed a challenging course and wants to share his experience with other students to help them make informed decisions. He decides to leave a review on our app. Alex appreciates the anonymity feature, as he feels more comfortable providing honest feedback without revealing his identity. He completes a detailed review, including a numerical rating and qualitative feedback on the professor's teaching style, the course content, and the level of effort required. He also adds relevant tags like "helpful feedback" and "requires consistent effort." Alex feels satisfied knowing that his feedback will help other students make well-informed decisions about taking the course, and he plans to use the app in the future to share his experiences with other courses and professors.
4. Professor Smith, is dedicated to continuously improving her teaching methods to provide the best learning experience for her students. After a semester of teaching a particularly challenging course, she is keen to receive feedback from her students to understand what worked well and what could be improved. She is aware that students might not always be comfortable providing honest feedback directly, so she decides to check the reviews on our app. Professor Smith finds a mix of positive and negative feedback, which she appreciates as it provides a more rounded view of her students' experiences. She notes the constructive feedback and identifies a few key areas for improvement, such as providing more real-world examples to illustrate complex concepts and offering more opportunities for students to ask questions during lectures. Professor Smith is grateful for the valuable insights provided by the app and plans to implement the suggested changes in her next course.
